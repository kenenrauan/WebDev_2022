    <p>Each HTML document can actually be referred to as a document tree. We describe the elements in the tree like we would describe a family tree. There are ancestors, descendants, parents, children and siblings.
    </p>
    <p> This is helpful for readability and to provide a consistent structure for styling and programmatic control with CSS and JavaScript.
